# EDLFCN

## This repo is about sentiment analysis using Enhanced Disentangled-Language-Focused Collaborative Network

## This is a robust framework for multimodal sentiment analysis that effectively handles noisy and incongruent data in real-world scenarios.

# Architecture Overview
### EDLFCN builds upon the DLF (Disentangled-Language-Focused) architecture with six novel components designed to enhance performance and robustness:

## 1. Dynamic Modality Gating
Adaptively weights modalities based on quality and alignment with language:

Computes gating scores: gm = œÉ(Wg[Entropy(Xm); Sim(Xm, XL)])
Emphasizes cleaner modalities in shared space while preserving unique features

## 2. Cross-Modal Consistency
Applies contrastive learning to align modalities:

Alignment loss: Lalign = -log(e^s(Shm,Shn)/œÑ / ‚àëe^s(Shm,Shk)/œÑ)
Preserves relationships between different modalities' shared features

## 3. Language-Guided Attention (LCCA)
Reinforcement learning optimizes attention weights:

Attention weights: Œ± = softmax(QlangK‚ä§mod)
Policy gradient update: ‚àáJ ‚àù R ¬∑ ‚àá log œÄ(Œ±|X)
Dynamically focuses on the most relevant audio/visual features

## 4. Multi-Scale Fusion
Implements hierarchical processing across multiple linguistic levels:

Ffinal = [CNNword(HL); BiGRUphrase(HL); Transformerutterance(HL)]

## 5. Adversarial Completion
GAN with language guidance for robust missing data reconstruction:

Generator: Xm_rec = G(Xm_noisy, HL)
Discriminator detects real/fake features
Loss: LGAN + Œª||Xm - Xm_rec||1

## 6. Cross-Modal Orthogonal Projection
Ensures separation between shared and specific subspaces:

Minimizes redundancy across modalities
Enforces orthogonality constraints
